# Access Manager

Static site for selecting user roles and door groups.

The site is published via [GitHub Pages](https://shakypizza.github.io/AccessManager/). If you receive a 404 error, ensure the URL uses the exact repository name with correct capitalization.

Source files reside in `src/`. The `docs/` directory is a symbolic link to `src/` so changes only need to be made in one place while still allowing GitHub Pages to serve the site.
